## üö® Disclaimer
I do not endorse nor condone raids. Any actions carried out by our tool are at your own risk. We are responsible for creating our tool, but not for how it is used.
To protect our work, and to prevent it from being re-distributed, we have not provided detailed development setup instructions.

## ‚õî Just to let you know.
- Using anything above 400 tokens with Deadcord is risky, and may cause your tokens to become locked. (Dont know why you would need this much anyway, seems like overkill).
- I am not responisble for anything you do with this tool. (Got to put that in there).
- I know there is going to be that one person that forks this repo and rebrands Deadcord into "their own program". Alright, follow the license. If you do not, I can always submit a DMCA take down request. Had it done before. Just follow the license and have some repect for my time.

## ‚ùì Why was Deadcord made?
Many people may question why we built Deadcord, let alone made it open-source. Deadcord was built to protest against several of Discords recent actions and decisions, among other things. We built Deadcord to protest against:

* The forced shutdown of `discord.py`.
* Switching every bot over to slash commands.
* Discord and YouTube partnership.
* Forcing small and big music bots out of business. It was someone's hobby.
* Not accepting feedback from the community.
* Locks a lot of new features behind paywalls or restricts them.
* Not focusing on the user experience.
* Against BetterDiscord.
* Hides behind their TOS to avoid lengthy user questions.
* Moving towards NFT's against community advice and kickback.
* Discord hypocrisy, introducing alt account system, when they want to prevent spam and raids.

## üöÄ Lets see the features
* Spam speed increases with each token you add.
* Deadcord averages about 290 pings every 2 seconds with 25 tokens.
* Bots can bypass reaction verify and member screening.
* Different spam modes: @everyone, mass user, blank, and lag. 
* Bots join and leave servers quickly with a short random delay. 
* Check if tokens are either locked, rate limited, alive, or invalid.
* Speak through a token in all channels.
* Change all bots nickname and status at once.
* Spoofs Discord client requests, bots act like real users.
* Injects directly into Discord, and uses custom UI elements using BetterDiscord.
* Chnage bot profile pictures with one click.
* Spam & Delete Webhook.
* Mass friend request spam.
* Hypesquad chnager (idk why people wanted this?).
* Auto adjusts ratelimits and spam speed.
* Can run on a localhost or remote server, which opens the possibbilty of a mobile raid client.

## üèÅ Setup for Development

I will not be providing in-depth setup instructions. Part of this is to protect my work, as well as the statement declared in the *disclaimer* section. If you wish to use our tool, download a release from our `releases` section. If you have any inquires,contact me personally on my Discord server.

## üß∞ Basic Usage

Download the latest release from our `releases` section. Download the file to a location of your choosing.

1. Create a file named `tokens.txt` in the same place as Deadcord. Make sure "View File Extensions" is enabled on Windows File Explorer.

- Your token file should follow this format:
   * No quotation marks.
   * Each token is on its own line.

2. Download the latest version of Deadcord from our `releases` section.
    
3. Download & Install our BetterDiscord plugin provided in this repo: https://github.com/GalaxzyDev/Deadcord-Client.

4. Make sure Deadcord is running in the background.

5. If the steps above finish successfully, you are good to go! Use the BetterDiscord plugin to interact with Deadcord.

## ‚ùì FAQ's
### Is this a Discord bot?
No, Deadcord is not a Discord **Bot**, it is a program to automate user accounts with their corresponding token.

### Can my tokens get phone-locked?
We have successfully tested Deadcord against several scenarios. You are able to spam constantly for 5 hours before your tokens are locked. If you use our tool wisely, they should never get phone-locked.

### Discord is going to patch it!1!11
There is only so many "patches" Discord can make until it starts effecting the user experience. Who knows, maybe this will help them fix their screwed up platform. Any patches that come up will *proabably* be reflected by Deadcord.
