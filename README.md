## 💀 About Deadcord

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are tons of Discord raid tools that claim "to be the best". We give you the full package, all the raid modules and utilites you may need. Deadcord has been throughly tested. We guarantee that your tokens are safe and sound when using our tool. We use the most effective methods possible.


##### 🚨 Disclaimer
I do not endorse nor condone raids. Any actions carried out by our tool are at your own risk. We are responsible for creating our tool, but not for how it is used.
To protect our work, and to prevent it from being re-distributed, we have not provided detailed development setup instructions.

##### ❓ Why was Deadcord made?
Many people may question why we built Deadcord, let alone make it open-source for many people to access. Deadcord was built to protest against several of Discords recent actions and decisions, among other things.

##### 🚀 Lets see the features
* Spam speed increases with each token you add.
* Deadcord averages about 20-30 pings a second with only 12 tokens.
* Bots can bypass simple verification.
* Auto-scrapes available channels to spam.
* Bots join and leave servers quickly. 
* Ping tokens to check if they are alive.
* Speak through a token in all channels.
* Chnage all bots nickname and status at once.
* Injects directly into Discord, and uses Discord's UI elements.
* **[FUTURE UPDATE]** Auto-scraping proxies.
* **[FUTURE UPDATE]** Chnage all of the bots profile pictures.
* **[FUTURE UPDATE ~ Beta]** Account Generator.

## 🏁 Getting Started

I will not be providng in-depth setup instructions. Part of this is to protect my work, as well as the statement declared in the *dsclaimer* section. If you wish to use our tool, download a release from our `releases` section.
